## Why another test framework? ##

Well, first of all read [AboutTCRun](AboutTCRun.md).  It'll probably answer most of your questions.  But in
short, because existing ones didn't help us as much as we needed for functional testing, nor
were they written for functional testing.

## Why .NET??? ##

Oh I toss and turn at night over this one, ok not really.  We needed to use some of .NET's
automation library for automating UIs, and that's why we chose it.  It was a matter of
necessity.  Once again, read [AboutTCRun](AboutTCRun.md).

## Will you do other languages? ##

Yes, we're planning on it.  Some languages we might just do plugins for other tools.
Python for instance has a great tool called [Nose](http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose)
, we have already started writing plugins for it to accomplish the same thing.

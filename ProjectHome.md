TCRun (and tcrunij or tcrun in java) is a command line tool, and a software test automation framework written by QA Software Engineers to help in writing, managing, and running automated test cases.  There is a version in C# for .NET (tcrun) and a version in Java (tcrunij).  Currently most of the development effort is going into tcrun in java, but the .NET version is stable and has been used for several years.

TCRunIJ, much like tcrun, is good for any type of functional testing.  However special effort has been made to make writing web tests that use the [Selenium 2.0 (WebDriver)](http://code.google.com/p/selenium) framework much easier to write.

For help and discussions and help take a look at the [tcrun users group](http://convore.com/tcrun).
